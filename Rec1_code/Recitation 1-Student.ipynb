    "- JuMP is a library that allows us to easily formulate optimization problems and solve them using a variety of solvers. It provides an easy interface to implement advanced optimization techniques.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Jupyter notebooks are **documents** (like a Word document) that can contain and run code.\n",
    "- They were originally created for Python as part of the IPython project, and adapted for Julia by the **IJulia** project.\n",
    "- They are very useful to **prototype**, draw **plots**, or even for teaching material like this one.\n",
