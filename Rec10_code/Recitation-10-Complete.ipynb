    "In an earlier recitation, we talked about the traveling salesman problem (TSP), where the goal is to find a minimum-length tour visiting a set of locations. The TSP has many \"cousins\", i.e., similar problems with additional complexity to represent practical considerations. One family of such problems are called vehicle routing problems (VRP), and seek to find the optimal set of routes for a *fleet* of vehicles to service a set of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples include:\n",
    "- Open vehicle routing problem (OVRP): we are given a set of customers that must each be visited exactly once by some vehicle. All routes start from a customer location and must end at a single location, called the \"depot\". An example of an application of this setting is car-pooling.\n",
    "- Capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP): in this setting, routes must begin and end at the depot, and each customer $i$ is now associated with a demand $d_i$, such that the total demand along any route cannot excced the vehicle capacity $Q$. This is a simplified version of the problem many delivery services face.\n",
